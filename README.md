### Deploying to heroku:

##### Make sure you have a remote to the heroku server. 

* To check your current remotes to the project, use `git remote -v`. For now you should have the origin remote.

* To add a heroku remote use [this documentation](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/git) or simply ```heroku git:remote -a interactive-map-deckgl```.

##### Now that the remote is connected, push the code to heroku.

* This process is the same as pushing code to bitbucket or github

* Example GitHub: ```git push origin master```

* Example BitBucket: ```git push origin master```

* Example Heroku: ```git push heroku master``` *heroku because thats the name of the remote.
